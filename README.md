# C++ Exercises

Welcome to the "cpp-exercises"! This collection of mini projects is designed to help you exercise and reinforce your understanding of basic C++ concepts.

## Getting Started

To get started with the exercises, it is recommended to use Visual Studio as your integrated development environment (IDE). Follow these steps:

1. Install Visual Studio from [Visual Studio Downloads](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).
2. During installation, select the "Desktop development with C++" workload.

If you prefer using an alternative, Code::Blocks is a good choice. Code::Blocks comes with an installer that includes a C++ compiler. You can download it from [Code::Blocks Downloads](http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads). Choose the version that includes the MinGW compiler (e.g., Code::Blocks with MinGW).
