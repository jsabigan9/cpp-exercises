# C++ Exercises

Welcome to the "cpp-exercises"! This collection of mini projects is designed to help you exercise and reinforce your understanding of basic C++ concepts.

## Getting Started

To get started with the exercises, make sure you have a C++ compiler installed on your machine. If you don't have one, you can [download and install a C++ compiler](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/index.html) compatible with your operating system.

If you prefer using Visual Studio, ensure that you have the C++ workload installed. If not, follow these steps:

1. Install Visual Studio from [Visual Studio Downloads](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).
2. During installation, select the "Desktop development with C++" workload.

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cpp-exercises.git
